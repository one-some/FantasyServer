## FantasyServer

Cool little poc for an AI-based http server. You can browse forever and ever....

Use KoboldAI (or a compatible endpoint) for integration

If I were to revisit this idea I'd use a faster model and maybe stable diffusion or the like for .png|.jpg|.jpeg|.gif|.webp and PIL to convert. Or just mimetype and trust the browser
